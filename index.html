      <p>Diplomat Bill Taylor said that he understood by early July that when President Trump appointees were talking about Ukraine launching “investigations” that they were talking about the desired probes into former Vice President Joe Biden and into conspiracy theories about the Democratic email hacks in 2016.  
         “I’m beginning to understand that there — that the investigations, again I’m not sure if there’s a crystal time, a specific time, but I’m beginning to understand that these investigations of Burisma and the 2016 elections are what the term ‘investigations’ refer to,” Taylor said. 
          A key sticking point in the inquiry is what was meant by “investigations.”</p>
          <br>
          
      <p> Some of Trump’s defenders have leaned into the vagueness of 
        this term, and Trump has said all he cares about is ending 
        corruption in Ukraine. But testimony from Taylor and other 
        witnesses suggests that it was widely understood that the “investigations” 
        were tantamount to political meddling by Ukraine.

      <p>The scary part for the rest of the NBA? The Clippers have piled up the 
        wins despite missing 2018-19 NBA MVP finalist Paul George, who has been 
        sidelined by a shoulder injury. Once the Clippers have the Leonard-George duo on the court together, they will boast a 1-2 punch that few around the Association can match.
        Philadelphia is tied for the best record in the Eastern Conference at 5-1 
        thanks to a star-powered roster that features the likes of 
        Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and Al Horford.</p>
